## Save file and assembler for my little logic sim CPU

## What's this?
This is my CPU i made in Digital Logic Sim by Sebastian Lague

## How to load the CPU into the sim?
Go into your **locallow** folder in your **appdata**, you can do that by pasting `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\SebastianLague\Digital-Logic-Sim\Projects` into the path textbox of explorer and copying the CPU directory there, the directory that should be there contains folders Chips and Deleted Chips!

## How do i use the assembler?
Read the **instructions** in the **assembler** folder

Right now i don't have a linux binary, but if you're desparate, you can compile main.cpp and figure everything out from there
