## Save file and assembler for my little logic sim CPU

## What's this?
This is my CPU i made in Digital Logic Sim by Sebastian Lague

## How to use
1. Download the source code for this repo (click the green "code" button and then press "download zip")
2. Load the CPU into the sim
3. Write some code in the assembler
4. Follow the rest of instructions in the assembler folder

## How to load the CPU into the sim?
Go into your **locallow** folder in your **appdata**, you can do that by pasting `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\SebastianLague\Digital-Logic-Sim\Projects` into the path textbox of explorer and copying the CPU directory there, the directory that should be there contains folders Chips and Deleted Chips!

## How do i use the assembler?
Read the **instructions** in the **assembler** folder

Right now i don't have a linux binary, but if you're desperate, you can compile main.cpp and figure everything out from there
