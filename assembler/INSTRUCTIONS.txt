HOW TO USE THIS THING:
1. make a project, i'd prefer .asm extention since it's literally assembly
2. write some code it in
3. run the program to compile it (main.exe) without any arguments to see what arguments it needs
IT'S A CLI TOOL! PLEASE RUN main.exe IN A CMD WINDOW!!!
4. copy each *_rom*.bin file into it's corresponding ROM (top to bottom), don't forget to clean it if you had bigger scripts in there!
5. PRESS THE START BUTTON

EXAMPLE COMMAND ORDER:
cd "C: place where you saved this (put in quotes if has spaces)"
main.exe examples/fibonacci.asm test

and now you'd have 3 test_rom*.bin files, you can open them, then ctrl + a and ctrl + c and then paste each to it's corresponding ROM via "paste all" in the simulation
again, press "clear all" first!

HOW TO ACTUALLY CODE IN IT:
each instruction has 3 arguments (except for MOV and JMP) -
2 that go into the function and the 3rd should come after a ->, it's where the result should be stored

location aliases:
put a % behind a value - screen
put a $ - ROM
A - register A
B - register B
and # - just a value, though you don't have to put it there (treated as constant)
you can also use [ ] to use dynamic addressing, which will use the resulting value as an address rather than the value, also:
you can put a register alias in there to use that register as the value to write
put % behind it to write to the screen

OPERATIONS:
MOV - write a value
ADD - add arguments
SUB - subtract arguments
OR - apply logic OR on arguments
AND - apply logic AND on arguments
XOR - apply logic XOR on arguments
JZ - jump to the value of the 2nd argument if the 1st argument is 0
JZA - same as JZ but adds the value of the 2nd argument instead
JZS - same as JZ but subtracts the value of the 2nd argument instead
JMP - jump to the location of the value of 1st argument
remember! when jumping, command addresses start at 0! also, they ignore comments

SCREEN CLARIFICATIONS:
1st bit - pixel state
2nd bit - reset the whole screen
